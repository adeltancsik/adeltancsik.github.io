## About this project

It intruduces me and my main, recent projects I am proud of now.
I provide my LinkedIn and GitHub profile as well.
This is a fully responsive site made with React.js, CSS3, Sass, and jQuery.
There is also a possibility to download my official CV.

### Development mode:

- npm start
- npm run watch:sass
- in index.js uncomment the icon-font.css import
- in index.js set the other source from style.min.css to style.css

### Before deploying:

- in index.js comment out the icon-font.css import
- in index.js set the other source from style.css to style.min.css
- exit from localhost and watch:sass
- npm run build:css

_At GitHub, it might be needed to set the custom domain again to adeltancsik.com, check if deployment was successful_
